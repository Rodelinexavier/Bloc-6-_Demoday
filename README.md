Project Description: This project involves developing an application that can identify the level of verbal aggression in certain conversations. This application could
possibly be used in schools to detect places where acts of violence take place through insults. We trained three models (logistic regression, xgboost and neural 
network) using a balanced database containing 138723 texts.

Notebooks folder: folder that contains the notebooks used for pre-processing, supervised learning (logistic regression, xgboost), deep learning with a neural network.

Local_Deploy_With_Microphone folder: folder that contains all the files to locally develop an application that records communications by a microphone
in a predefined time interval and gives an aggressiveness score using three models: logistic regression, xgboost and neural network.

APP_in_production_streamlit folder: folder that contains all the files to put in production on streamlit an application that reads a wav file containing
conversations, divides it into sentence and gives for each sentence an aggressiveness score using three models: logistic regression, xgboost and neural network.
